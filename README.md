OPTIMAL DEAD RECKONING OF MOBILE ROBOT USING A*  ALGORITHM 

Optimal path between 2 points in the robot arena is calculated using the A* algorithm, and the generated path is followed by the differential robot using the pure pursuit algorithm. The entire simulation is performed in MATLAB and SIMULINK.
